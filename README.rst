Dungeon and Dragon game 
========================
This code has a dragon-like feel to it, but it still has some bugs that will be fixed in the future.
All of the code has been edited to adhere to the pep 8 rules,except for the long lines of code which were not addressed due to time constraints.

Although this file is intended to provide information to users, it would have been easier to inform you about the program through this file.

As per your request, I have created a plan for the project. However, I am facing difficulty in implementing character movement.
Therefore, I decided to focus on more important concepts first and deal with the movement later.

Recently, I encountered a problem wherein I branched out to five different ways of thinking and even implemented classes in a better way.
The refactoring also improved the project. However, I made a mistake that caused the project to crash.
As a result, I had to switch to an earlier version and will need to revisit the issue at a later time.

Currently, the log file has not been used effectively.
However, a log has been added to the main class to provide updates on wins and losses. This feature will be further developed in the future.
